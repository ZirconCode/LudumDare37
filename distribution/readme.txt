Tales of Sir Salamander
-----------------------

This is a Jam entry for Ludum Dare 37 by Simon and Niklas.

Instructions:
Get to the top of the Room. Step on the blinking boxes to do stuff, if your toad looks a bit pale he needs to rest before doing more stuff. Have fun!

Controls:
WASD or Arrow Keys to Move/Jump
C to Reset Level if you get Stuck during Puzzles (this button should never be necessary)

Tips:
If you seem to get stuck on the ground, Jump. It's just an illusion.
